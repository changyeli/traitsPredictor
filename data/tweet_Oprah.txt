@tpoulos this is IT!!
@rempower @3LWTV nothing like it.. No hints would come close .. Please let me know when you start reading it.
@lizkinnell I read back in December .. But wasn't sure y'all could handle it. Still not sure. Interested to see the reaction.
@3LWTV you Lonnell are not only going to LOVE it. I'm sure you will agree with me. I'd bet on it!
Tomorrow morning announcing new book club selection . So excited . I honestly have NEVER read a book like this before.
@Joy_Rizing everybody needs a break! We're 26 weeks of new shows. God you're watching.
@CarpeDiemJBS @SheriSalata @awardnow @mistyonpointe good idea Jas.
Loving this new show are y'all watching?
#InDeepShift
I'm staying tune for new show In Deep Shift.
I can honest say I feel better after watching this show . Thank you all for joining me.#SuperSoulSunday
What we're all seeking is a personal experience of our divine nature. #SuperSoulSunday
@GaOWNers I love how gems of wisdom always resonates on this show. My gift I loooove sharing with the world.#SuperSoulSunday
RT @RichOnOWN: Religion is the map. It isn’t the destination. #SuperSoulSunday @RichardRohrOFM @Oprah
@kenlikebarbie my spiritual practice is Stillness and Kindness. #SuperSoulSunday
@tpoulos @EckhartTolle yes time for me to read it again..A NEW EARTH lifted my life . #SuperSoulSunday
Gotta say @EckhartTolle teaching about stress has saved me many a day. Stress is wanting what is to be something it isn't. #SuperSoulSunday
"If you don't transform your suffering you transmit it". Wonderful nuggets for the soul. Thanks @RichardRohrOFM #SuperSoulSunday
"When you don't need to play the victim or create victims you're free". Loved this @RichardRohrOFM #SuperSoulSunday
@kenlikebarbie what breaks my heart w/news,the same stories repeated, we as a species don't seem to learn the lessons. #SuperSoulSunday
@amandeepc @RichardRohrOFM yep I get that . It's the "ego" that's offended.
#SuperSoulSunday
"Whenever you take offense it's always the false self that is offended "ok @RichardRohrOFM
@ChrisHeuertz @RichardRohrOFM loved that one too. "God is a VERB."About what you DO, how you treat your self and others.
@ChristinabellGH to your grandpa.
God isn't a being as much as God is the grounding of BEING itself. Loved this from @RichardRohrOFM #SuperSoulSunday
@3LWTV Lonell like the new pic.

@tpoulos I would never be in a movie with gratuitous violence. The violence in SELMA is historically documented.
@tpoulos yes I'm funny. But in a movie?
@AVAETC I always thought that was why you were working 20hr days to show the WHOLE film. Congratulations 
@3LWTV @LifeYouWantTour always , always the people and what they take away.

@GrowingOWN you know trending with these conversations makes my heart double grin❤️
I 'm reading the most profound book I've ever encountered regarding parenting. The CONSCIOUS PARENT /Shefali Tsabary PhD. Interviewing Tues.
@PhoebeFeed @OWNTV before I started OWN was having these conversations. They're the reason for #SuperSoulSunday
@SimonSaysLife @OWNAmbassadors but good to know right. It shows up All the time..got to keep it in check. #Ego #ANewEarth
@OWNingLight @EckhartTolle Correct . And more, ego is identification with any form. Consciousness is formless. #ANewEarth
Find out how practice and patience changed @dionne247.  Read her update here http://t.co/UxPlkgRhPb
You can watch Livestream Where ever you are. Right now . @EckhartTolle #ANewEarth
@JettikaSiregar @kerrywashington the universe will not support you in a desire to be someone else. Only You.
@alfier288 are you watching #ANewEarth from Ireland?
@GrowingOWN @EckhartTolle yep that's big aha
"arrogance is a sign of fear of inferiority".. So true, thanks for the clarity @EckhartTolle  #ANewEarth
@bevysmith @Pharrell @OWNTV I agree one of most inspiring interviews I've ever done. luv Luv the way he thinks!
"His need to win drains him of power" that was an aha for me. Thanks @EckhartTolle  #ANewEarth
@DevlinHuxtable those were my backyard trees. Watching them made my heart swell. And butterflies in my garden.
@DevlinHuxtable @UncleRUSH yep! Interviewing him this week.
@Official_AlexB_ @SuperSoulSunday @JaneGoodallInst good call..already booked her!
"We become what we pay attention to" I know this for sure.

@OwnAmbassador  everything is a chapter, because we're always evolving. Change is constant. Nothing stays the same. #SuperSoulSunday
RT @OwnAmbassador: @Oprah @PaoloPresta So many things are just meant to be a chapter for you, not the whole book #SuperSoulSunday
"You are Enough".. Greatest lesson I've learned. #SuperSoulSunday
"Our true identity is in God ".. @EckhartTolle will be talking about our Roles vs. TrUE Self on A NEW EARTH immediately following this .
RT @kenlikebarbie: Yes! We should take our OWN breath once in a while! YES!! @Oprah #SuperSoulSunday
@3LWTV @suemonkkidd wow I think nothing could be worse than to whimp out on ourselves .  #SuperSoulSunday
@3LWTV "no" means A no ther way! #SuperSoulSunday
@kenlikebarbie I found that so interesting "failure of courage".. Another way of saying "settling". #SuperSoulSunday
@DeepakChopra @ijones9857 @audioboo Deepak join us for #SuperSoulSunday excited that we start 21 day meditation tomorrow.
@DevlinHuxtable no, she's now starting her own dance company in Brooklyn
.@nada0971 did you hear that? Whatever brings us alive.. We should follow? #SuperSoulSunday
@PaoloPresta  you and me both.. What if we had stayed and worked in our fathers stores??  #SuperSoulSunday
@nada0971 I agree but to NOT follow your dream is to live a thousand deaths. #SuperSoulSunday
If I had remained a reporter I would have been "homesick " Whereas  @GayleKing  is most at home, you can tell on @CBSThisMorning .
"Prayer is the attention of the heart" loved that didn't you ? The soul often speaks thru longing. #SuperSoulSunday
@CarpeDiemJBS we must have been at the same church. :)
After this interview I went and read Thomas Merton.. Wanted to see what had  inspired @suemonkkidd  #supersoulsunday
Anyone struggling to find meaning in everyday life is going to LOOOVE this conversation. @suemonkkidd #SuperSoulSunday
